Feedback from Kristine (from email)

Despite the brief delay with the technical challenge of having each team member voice over, I really like the idea of having each team member introduce themselves.  

BTW, I used this data set because these ARE metrics of government performance - it is what GOC is using as its own metrics.  

I quite like the overview slide, which told me where you were going.  I also like the way you moved into the insights you gained from your data!!  You told me that factors affecting the number of services was influenced by website visits and fees.  And your summary which reinforced this was excellent.
